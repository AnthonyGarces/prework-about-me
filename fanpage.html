    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>     At a performance at Glastobury music festival, rapper, producer, mogul Kanye West proclaimed "I am the greatest living rock star on the planet",
    a statement that increasingly feels true as time passes. Atlanta native, Kanye spent his childhood in Chicago after the divorce of his parents. His mother
    Donda West was a professor of English at Chicago State university and managed her son's career until her death in 2007.
    Kanye quickly became interested in the city's hip hop scene where he befriended famous producer No I.D. Kanye eventually dropped out of college to pursue his music career 
    full time, where he quickly established his unique sound with other artists like Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Alicia Keys. He eventually received an opportunity to produce and rap his own material,
    an opportunity previously denied to him because of his image as a "soft" rapper. 21 Grammys later alongside 69 other nominations, Kanye continues to push the genre of rap, either through his
    musical genius or through his business savvy. His shoe line is one one of the most recognizable in the world, while his record label continues to churn out record breaking artists. At every step in his career, Kanye has pushed boundaries and spoken his mind,
    which has led to numerous controversies. For a full list of his controversies, please visit <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/marcusjones/kanye-west-controversies-timeline">here</a>
